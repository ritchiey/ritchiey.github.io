## Projects and Clients

[Pin Payments](https://www.pin.net.au)
I\'m currently working with Pin Payments to help expand their acclaimed
payment solution.

[Persist.TV](https://persist.tv)
I wanted a daily workout schedule to keep my Krav Maga skills sharp
between classes so I invented this. Unfortunately the the Krav Maga
videos are private to the club so I\'m currently looking for content
experts to record videos for public consumption.

[MyEDiary](https://www.myediary.com.au)
I had the privilege of working with entrepreneur Louisa Wood from [Get Positive](http://www.getpositive.com.au/) to turn her vision of an online homework diary into a working product used by thousands of Australian Students daily.
